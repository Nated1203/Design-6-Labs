# Design-6-Labs
## Labs Completed by *Nate Dawson*

---

**Lab 1**
*GHDL and GTKWave*
- In this lab I downloaded the GHDL and GTKWAVE software to describe and simulate hardware examples
- This was completed with the tutorial by [Nerdy Dave](https://youtu.be/H2GyAIYwZbw?si=BPTJ1yH9rXGcyoHP)

1. Half Adder Example
   - I downloaded the half adder and half adder test bench vdhl code from the resources
   - These were opened through notepad to compile the code
   - There were no errors during this process
   - Through the windows terminal the following commands launched the compiled code through *GTKWAVE*

2. D Flip-Flop Example
   - For the second example I chose to use the D Flip-Flop
   - The codes were accessed and compiled using the same method
   - There were no errors during this process
   - Through the windows terminal the following commands launched the compiled code through *GTKWAVE*

**Lab 2**
*Raspberry Pi*
- In this lab I connected my Rasberry Pi 4b to my computer through SSH connection hosted by the Putty application
- The connection works by connecting both my computer and my Raspberry Pi to my mobile hotspot
- Then by giving Putty the IP address of the Pi I am able to log in and type commands in the terminal of my Pi from my computer
